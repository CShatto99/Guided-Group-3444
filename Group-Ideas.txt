Idea 3: Portal 2 Leadersboards through Steam API Integration:
	Using Steam developer API to pull leaderboard information from official steam leaderboards. Official leaderboard tracks time, and UID information. This
	proposed leaderboard takes that information, and builds a user-maintained leaderboard with moderation options to ban users / scores, require proof in the form
	of video or demo files (.dem proof files) and change rulesets. Also allows for users to manually submit proof for levels that are not officially kept on 
	Steam leaderboards.

		Stack Includes:
			* Front end UI (User submitting of times/proof comments, moderators removing times/players, overall visual design)
			* Back-End API (Fetching data through Steam API, database interface for website and demo storage)
			* DB Management (Storage of the .dem files (Google Drive?))
			* Webserver (XAMPP, SQL)
