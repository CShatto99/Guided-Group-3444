Idea 1: Personal Library Web/Mobile Application
	This application will allow a user to sign up and either enter in or scan their personal books, movies, or games.  Our
	application will then store their items on a DB and allow them to search through their items.  Uses for this could be to
	catalogue their books to track if they own the item, lent the item to a friend, or are even trying to find a good way to sort
	the items on a bookshelf (by author, genre, title, etc.)

		Stack Includes:
			* Front-end UI for web application (in some kind of front-end framework like React, Angular, etc.)
			* Mobile application for Android or iOS or both to perform same function as web application
			* Back-end API to handle communication between front-end UI, mobile device, and DB
			* DB Management

Idea 2: Company Ride Share Application - Trabajo (trah-bah-hoh)
		Trabajo is an application that allows companies to sign up for ride sharing for employees to and from work alongside other necessary
		travelling (external meetings, conferences, social events). Employees, through their company, can then request to be added to/removed
		from certain rides. Trabajo drivers can be among the company's employees or other Trabajo users. This application can potentially
		save the company and its employees time and money alongside benefitting the environment.

		Stack Includes:
			* Front-end UI for web/progressive application (React, Angular; users can see what rides they're on, companies what rides they sign up for)
			* Back-end API (managing communication between front-end and database)
			* Database Management (storage of company, employees, and ride information)
			* Potential mobile application

Idea 3: Portal 2 Leadersboards through Steam API Integration:
	Using Steam developer API to pull leaderboard information from official steam leaderboards. Official leaderboard tracks time, and UID information. This
	proposed leaderboard takes that information, and builds a user-maintained leaderboard with moderation options to ban users / scores, require proof in the form
	of video or demo files (.dem proof files) and change rulesets. Also allows for users to manually submit proof for levels that are not officially kept on
	Steam leaderboards.

		Stack Includes:
			* Front end UI (User submitting of times/proof comments, moderators removing times/players, overall visual design)
			* Back-End API (Fetching data through Steam API, database interface for website and demo storage)
			* DB Management (Storage of the .dem files (Google Drive?))
			* Webserver (XAMPP, SQL)
